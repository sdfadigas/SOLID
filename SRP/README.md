The __Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)__ is one of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that each class should have only one responsibility or job.

To demonstrate how the SRP works in Python, considering a real problem: a system for managing employee data. I created two classes: one for storing employee data and another for displaying employee data.

In the `Employee` class, I have defined a constructor that takes in the name, ID number, and salary of an employee. I also have created three methods for getting the name, ID number, and salary of an employee.

In the `EmployeePrinter` class, I have defined a constructor that takes in an instance of the Employee class. I also have created a `print_employee_data method` that prints out the name, ID number, and salary of the employee.

By separating the responsibilities of storing and displaying employee data into two separate classes, we are following the SRP. If we later need to make changes to how employee data is displayed, we can modify the EmployeePrinter class without affecting the `Employee` class. Similarly, if we need to make changes to how employee data is stored, we can modify the Employee class without affecting the `EmployeePrinter` class.

This separation of concerns makes our code more modular and easier to maintain, which is an important principle in object-oriented programming.
